# üìä Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## üß† Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan using historical loan data. Through extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building, the goal is to identify patterns that distinguish defaulters from fully paid loans.

---

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset includes borrower and loan-level information such as:
- **Loan Amount**, **Term**, **Interest Rate**, **Employment Length**
- **Income**, **Home Ownership**, **Grade/Subgrade**
- **Loan Status** (Target: Fully Paid or Charged Off)

> The dataset is imbalanced, with a higher proportion of fully paid loans compared to defaults.

---

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values:** Handled appropriately across all key features.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Used Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- **Feature Scaling:** Applied Standard Scaler on numerical features.
- **Feature Selection:** Removed unnecessary zip codes and transformed data types as needed.

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis
Used **hvPlot** to create interactive visualizations:
- Loan Amount and Installment distribution by loan status
- Loan status breakdown by Grade, Sub-grade, and Home Ownership
- Income and Employment Length analysis
- Distribution of annual income with highlight on high-income borrowers

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Handling Class Imbalance
To address the imbalance between fully paid and defaulted loans:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** was applied to balance the classes.
- Class distribution post-SMOTE:
  - **Charged Off:** 50%
  - **Fully Paid:** 50%

## ü§ñ Model Building
Trained multiple machine learning models to evaluate performance:

### ‚úÖ Best Performing Model
- **Random Forest Classifier**
  - Balanced accuracy: **~87.4%**
  - Precision (Fully Paid): **~87.8%**
  - Precision (Charged Off): **~66.7%**

üìâ **Confusion Matrix (Test Set):**
